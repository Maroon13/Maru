While she still strives to become a police officer, a surprise gift on her 16th birthday changed her life and led her to live a life she really wanted to have: the life of a hero. Just not one she expected to live.

                                        Living the life of a hero was a dream that a lot of young children have and wish to become, but as they get older, they start to either stop wishing to be one or they try and pursue jobs that can be considered heroic work for some people, like doctors, firefighters, or a police officer.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        As for the daughter of the police officer Hikari Naona, for Nanada Hanaka that meant following her mother’s footsteps to becoming a police officer. Though the road to becoming a police officer can often be a long one, the drive she has is still present which lead her to pass middle school and enroll herself into EUREKA high school.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        But even in her time as a student she was helping the people out, although with less eventful things such as chores or stuff. Giving people a helping hand and her charisma had gained her a reputation within the people of Lawain. But even with all that, even when she’s nearing the age of 16 there was one thing that kept her going: a dream of her wanting to Become a hero due to the heroes of Lawain, even if little is known about the heroes themselves.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Due to her admiration towards the heroes of her city, she strived to look for ways to become a hero or someway like it. She had some help from her best friend Akari. A little bit of aura training here and there, even getting some gear for her that helped her out such as the boots she wears on a day to day basis. She had been training, but never came that far. Even with that, she enjoyed what she did with Akari, even talking with her about the topic of heroes.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        That was sort of her daily life. That was until her life took a turn at the age of 16.

                                        Another day gone by, another day older. It was the day before her birthday which was also her first day attending at EUREKA high school. Her day went about as smooth as she would hoped for. Making new friends and what not, with her and Akari attending the same classes. Nothing much happened as it was just a getting to know the teachers and each other as well as a tour around the school building, getting the books before being able to head back home and once they were done for today, Akari and Hanaka enjoyed the day like they always do, until they decided to go back to their homes once the sun sets. It was a normal day like any other even back home. She checked her phone and the TV for any news regarding heroes, chatting with Akari and other friends on the phone and or PC, eating food and what not until it was time to head to bed for the night.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Once the clock reached 12:00 AM / 00:00 in the morning when Hanaka was soundly asleep, she started to have what seemed like a lucid dream. In that Lucid dream, she was inside what seemed like a white void, with some sparks of electricity that seemed to be far away. in front of her she noticed a what seemed like a humanoid being that almost took on her appearance in shape, but the colors where all white and or light-ish grey, with what seemed to be blue markings and lines along the other’s body. The only color that stayed the same were the blue eyes. As Hanaka wanted to ask who the other is and if she is dreaming. Immediately without any delay the other responded that she wasn’t dreaming and that they’re currently in a device able to help her out with her future endeavor, whilst calling her by the title of master. With Hanaka being confused as to what’s going on and weirded out by what the other called her, they explained the situation.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        The stranger explained that they’re an entity programmed to help the user of the device, with Hanaka being the user they have been programmed to help in her journey of becoming a hero. Upon being asked by Hanaka if her mother or Akari made it, they shook her head, explaining that they did not create them, nor can they disclose that information yet other than they’re created by some people who were close to her. Unsure of all of that, Hanaka asked if she has a say in it and if there’s things needed of her. The entity nodded, stating that it’s her decision if she wants to accept it or not as well as if there’s anything needed of them in return. 
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Uncertain of more things, Hanaka asked what she can expect if she accepts the help, in which the entity responded that the device will be linked to her using her aura and aura channels that resides in her body alongside the fact that they’ll help her out learning to harness her powers until she mastered it and that they’ll aid her in the energy output and such things if need be. The only thing they requested of her outside of accepting the help is to keep it between the two of them for the time being for the powers she may wield can be potentially dangerous if in the wrong hands.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        While risking her career may be something she didn’t want and she just met the entity, her dream of being a hero may come true if she accepted it.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        In the end, Hanaka reluctantly agreed to the request, but asked if they had a name. They responded that they weren’t given a name yet, but would accept the name if she wished to do so. After a couple of seconds of thinking, Hanaka decided to give the entity the name “Chokey”, pronounced as “cho-gee”. The entity agreed to that. With the entity having gotten the name Chokey, Hanaka asked if that if she can end the deal if she changes her mind at some point, in which Chokey nodded, telling her that she’s their master and that they’ll keep every request in mind. With that, she asked one last question: how she can get out of this space they’re in. Chokey responded that they can do it for her for now, before they asked if she has any questions. After a second of thinking, Hanaka nodded, asking if they can bring her back. With a nod, they did just that.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        The next thing Hanaka knows, she was back in bed, it was early in the morning while the alarm went off. But on her lap was what seemed to be a simple looking collar with a crystal like marble connected to it. Upon laying hands on it, she somewhat had the feeling that that was the device Chokey was talking about. Confused on why it’s a collar, Hanaka decided to that it’s best not to question it for not. This day is her birthday after all, so she should enjoy it. So with that, she decided to bring the Collar with her.
